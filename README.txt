# Data on invasion of Calvert Island by *Orthione griffenis*
This document describes the data associated with surveys of the blue mud shrimp (*Upogebia pugettensis* Dana) and the invasive parasite it hosts, *Orthione griffenis* Markham, on Calvert Island in 2018 and 2019.

*Orthione griffenis* is a marine isopod that parasitizes mud shrimp (genus *Upogebia*). It was seen in Central British Columbia, Canada, for the first time in 2017 during the Hakai-MarineGEO BioBlitz on Calvert Island. The data and analysis herein document the first observations of parasite prevalence north of Vancouver Island.
